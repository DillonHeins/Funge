\section{The Team}

	\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
	Having some experience with web developement, I am excited to test my skills on this project. The concept of a drone control hub is very exciting and it is a novel idea and I think that coupling drones with a web portal would be a unique experience.
	\\\\
	I enjoy creating complex systems, and finding solutions to difficult problems is very satisfying for me. I believe that creating the back-end of this project presents an opportunity to really push myself and it is a challenge I would be excited to tackle. There is also room for greater complexity to be added, which is very exciting!

\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
This project seems to tick all the right boxes for me. At first glance, the project's major component is a web-based portal where users can interact with a system to personalise and schedule their drone missions. This creates a playground for engaging and efficient web design - a dream for a developer such as myself.
\\\\
In addition to the portal however, the creation of a back-end server to process the information from the client ensures that this project will allow me to stretch not only my front-end skills, but my proficiency as a full-stack developer.
\\\\
Finally, and as a welcome bonus, the project also makes provision for even greater challenges. The opportunity to interface and possibly control hardware in an exciting real-world scenario is difficult to pass by. The project perfectly balances algorithmic and technical complexity with an exciting problem space. Plus, Retro Rabbit itself has already done much to impress me, and it would be an honour to work for them.

\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
As a BIS Multimedia student I am particularly interested in web development. This project presents a platform which would enable me to learn a great deal about web development in practice. It not only involves the creation and design of a client-side portal but the programming of a back-end server. It offers the opportunity to develop my full-stack skills which is something that is very valuable.\\\\
I am very fond of the latest web technologies and have been itching to create a web based application using something other than the LAMP stack. Another key point of this project which has enticed me is the extensions. They have motivated me to not only want to deliver the base product but something more. Being able to integrate the system with the hardware is a very exciting prospect which I would love to aim for.

\section{Project Execution}
	\subsection{Development Methodology}
		\input{../developmentMethodology}
	\subsection{Methods of Informing Client}
		\input{../informingClient}
	\subsection{Initial Ideas for Solving Technical Challenges}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item MVC should be used to decouple the interface from the functional logic.
		\item The interface should be easy to use. Functionality should include:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A login system for client access.
			\item A report system to view past missions.
			\item A system to create a new mission.
			\item A system to view progress on current missions.
			\item A notification system to alert clients to completed missions.
		\end{itemize}
		\item The server should be able to handel any requests, and should link up with the drones.
		\item The results of a mission should be processed by the server:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Single images and videos are easy to store and retrieve.
			\item Image stitching and orthophoto generation needs to be accurate and fast.
			\item By using AI and image recognition, the images can be processed to count cars, people etc.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Possible Technologies to Use for Project}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item For the portal interface, HTML5 should be used.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Google Maps can be used to track drones and place coordinates for drone missions.
				\item JavaScript can be used for basic web processing.
			\end{itemize}
			\item It is possible to create a RESTful API to be run on a server using a variety of different languages and technologies, some being:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item C/C++ - Fast and efficient
				\item Java - Slower but more intuitive
				\item Django/Python - Slowest yet easier to program and forces the use of MVC
				\item Node.js - Lightweight and efficient
			\end{itemize}
			\item Each language/technology has its advantages and disadvantages. A final decision would be more wise to make after consulting with the client as well as learning more about the drone API.
		\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Final Deliverable}
	As specified in the proposal.
