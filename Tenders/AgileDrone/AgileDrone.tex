\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
One part of computer technology that has always captured my imagination is the beauty of complexity that can occur in systems, no matter how simple they might seem on the surface. This project presents an opportunity to help others understand the underlying structure of a large, complex system, and I am always looking for chances to help others understand how systems work.
\\\\		
The complexity of the problem at hand is enticing. I enjoy a challenge and finding solutions to problems is very satisfying for me; the harder the problem, the more satisfying it is to solve. The difficulty of visualising large, complex networks, and then optimizing that solution, is a challenge I would very much like to tackle.
\\\\			
I am interested in the opportunity to be creative with the solution that this project presents. Being able to introduce my own skills and strengths into the project is a great opportunity to really push myself and expand my toolset of skills.
\\\\			
Finally, I am looking forward to learning and using the EC2 API. The idea of flexible server hosting that can dynamically grow and change as needed is very interesting, and having the chance to work with the platform would be a great opportunity to learn and grow my skills.

\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
This project seems to tick all the right boxes for me. At first glance, the major component of this project is a web-based portal where users can interact with a system to personalise their drone missions.

\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
Personally I want to do this project as I am fascinated by the intricacies and the workings of networks. By doing this project I feel as though I would learn an immense amount about networks that could only be learnt by doing something as in-depth as this project. This project offers many different sets of problems from the algorithmic and data structure problems to the visualising of the information problems, all of which are problems which I would enjoy solving.
\\\\		
Another main reason for me wanting to do this project is the fact that I enjoy and am skilled in the effective presentation and communication of information. I feel as though this project offers a great platform to manipulate and visualise very complex information. As a student I too have experienced the problems of not being able to accurately visualise the workings of a network.
\\\\		
Expanding on the above, this is a project which I would be heavily and personally invested in as it offers many challenging rewards for completing it. The software being designed is something which I would personally want to use and being able to create software which one would want to use is enough motivation in and of itself.

\section{Project Execution}
	\subsection{Development Methodology}
		We intend to follow the Scrum approach to Agile software development throughout the course of project development. Agile itself is not a methodology and does not provide concrete steps which we would be able to follow. Hence we have opted to incorporate Scrum specific methods within the Agile movement. The reasons we have considered to use this methodology are as follows:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The agile approach ensures that we as a team will be able to respond effectively and efficiently to unpredictability through incremental, iterative sprints
			\item These short sprints enable us to ensure that the product is kept in a potentially shippable state at all times
			\begin{itemize}
				\item This is effective as it ensures the product is always integrated and tested
				\item By having these short sprints of development it will enable us to periodically demonstrate our product to the client so that we are able to receive feedback, adapt to said feedback and plan accordingly for the next sprint
			\end{itemize}
			\item Scrum and agile work well together as Scrum is simple and flexible
			\item Scrum enables test-driven development
			\item Agile incorporates both the business and technical side and enables all involved with the project to engage and function together
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Scrum only has three roles: Product owner, Team, and Scrum Master
				\item These roles bode well to the nature of this project
			\end{itemize}
			\item To summarise: Scrum emphasises "empirical feedback, team self management, and striving to build properly tested product increments within short iterations"
			\begin{itemize}
				\item This ensures the continuous act of inspecting and adapting in order to deal with complexity and risk
				\item Our team is responsible for self management which enables us to function well without having to have continuous contact with our client
				\item Scrum decision making revolves around real-world situations and feedback rather than assumption
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
