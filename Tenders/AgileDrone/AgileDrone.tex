\section{The Team}

	\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
	Having some experience with web developement, I am excited to test my skills on this project. The concept of a drone control hub is very exciting and it is a novel idea and I think that coupling drones with a web portal would be a unique experience.
	\\\\
	I enjoy creating complex systems, and finding solutions to difficult problems is very satisfying for me. I believe that creating the back-end of this project presents an opportunity to really push myself and it is a challenge I would be excited to tackle. There is also room for greater complexity to be added, which is very exciting!

\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
This project seems to tick all the right boxes for me. At first glance, the project's major component is a web-based portal where users can interact with a system to personalise and schedule their drone missions. This creates a playground for engaging and efficient web design - a dream for a developer such as myself.
\\\\
In addition to the portal however, the creation of a back-end server to process the information from the client ensures that this project will allow me to stretch not only my front-end skills, but my proficiency as a full-stack developer.
\\\\
Finally, and as a welcome bonus, the project also makes provision for even greater challenges. The opportunity to interface and possibly control hardware in an exciting real-world scenario is difficult to pass by. The project perfectly balances algorithmic and technical complexity with an exciting problem space. Plus, Retro Rabbit itself has already done much to impress me, and it would be an honour to work for them.

\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
Personally I want to do this project as I am fascinated by the intricacies and the workings of networks. By doing this project I feel as though I would learn an immense amount about networks that could only be learnt by doing something as in-depth as this project. This project offers many different sets of problems from the algorithmic and data structure problems to the visualising of the information problems, all of which are problems which I would enjoy solving.
\\\\		
Another main reason for me wanting to do this project is the fact that I enjoy and am skilled in the effective presentation and communication of information. I feel as though this project offers a great platform to manipulate and visualise very complex information. As a student I too have experienced the problems of not being able to accurately visualise the workings of a network.
\\\\		
Expanding on the above, this is a project which I would be heavily and personally invested in as it offers many challenging rewards for completing it. The software being designed is something which I would personally want to use and being able to create software which one would want to use is enough motivation in and of itself.
