		\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
		The inherent nature of this project means that I will not only be challenged in terms of the application of my Computer Science knowledge, but I will also be exposed to a new field of trade, financial markets and the economy.
\\\\
This project will, above all else, provide a valuable learning experience and the finished system is one that can be applied in real-world situations. The project scope is clear and the client is well-known in the industry.

		\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
		This will be a very fun and challenging project. I have had a growing interest in financial market simulations for a while now, so this is a perfect opportunity for us to learn more about them.\\
		
		I am very interested in creating artificial intelligence that can do this type of analysis - I have been wanting to do this since last year, and was going to start doing this anyway so it would be great to do it for a company that can advise and guide us.\\

		Our recent lectures in AI have really inspired me, and I am excited to get my feet wet, especially dabbling with trade algorithms involving AI.

	\subsection{Initial Ideas for Solving Technical Challenges}
	Functional programming could be used to solve the concurrent, and algorithmic challenges.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The expressiveness of functional programming is a major benefit as this will allow us to write the algorithms in a very clear and concise manner.
		\item Testing is made easier and more definite in a functional language as you have pure functions without side-effects.
		\item The thread-safe nature of functional programming is perfect for the concurrent needs of the system.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Possible Technologies to Use for Project}
	.NET would be our go-to choice for technology since we could use the functional language F\# and combine it with C\# code and libraries if needed. F\# is really powerful and succinct, and combines functional programming with the best aspects of Object-Orientated programming. \\

	Correctness of the software is obviously a concern as a mistake in the code could cause a lot of money to be lost. The succinctness and static typing of F\# helps greatly with this, as it is much easier to reason about strongly typed, clear and well-written code.\\

	A great type system and/or DSL (domain specific language) can be created within F\# to assist in the development and verification of the system.\\

	The other great thing about the type system is that you can catch most bugs at compile time, rather than getting unwanted surprises at runtime. \\

	Here is some example F\# code that analyses stock markets: \href{http://www.tryfsharp.org/Learn/financial-computing#analyzing-stock-markets}{TryF\# - Analysing Stock Markets}

	\subsection{Final Deliverable}
	As specified in the proposal.
