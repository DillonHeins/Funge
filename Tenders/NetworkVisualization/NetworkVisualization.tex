		\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
			One part of computer technology that has always captured my imagination is the beauty of complexity that can occur in systems, no matter how simple they might seem on the surface. This project presents an opportunity to help others understand the underlying structure of a large, complex system, and I am always looking for chances to help others understand how systems work.
\\\\		
			The complexity of the problem at hand is enticing. I enjoy a challenge and finding solutions to problems is very satisfying for me; the harder the problem, the more satisfying it is to solve. The difficulty of visualising large, complex networks, and then optimizing that solution, is a challenge I would very much like to tackle.
\\\\			
			I am interested in the opportunity to be creative with the solution that this project presents. Being able to introduce my own skills and strengths into the project is a great opportunity to really push myself and expand my toolset of skills.
\\\\			
			Finally, I am looking forward to learning and using the EC2 API. The idea of flexible server hosting that can dynamically grow and change as needed is very interesting, and having the chance to work with the platform would be a great opportunity to learn and grow my skills.

	\subsection{Gian Paolo Buffo}
	\textbf{Profile:}\\
	My favourite part about software development is being able to blend creativity and functionality to create efficient, interactive and engaging software. I am most interested in multimedia software implementations, where the user experience comes above all else. In my spare time I like to go hiking or geek it out with a good book, videogame or boardgame.

	\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
	Having taken Computer Networks as a 3rd year module, I was overjoyed to find that my high 	expectations were well met. 
\\\\
There is an intangible beauty and satisfaction that comes with figuring out how to make machines talk to one another. From the humble beginnings of a simple Telnet chat system, one can already see the immense potential that lies behind networking. I am happy with how much I have managed to learn about the intricacies of networking in a short time, but I am not yet satisfied. I know that there is still so much more to learn, and I cannot wait.
\\\\
	What really stood out for me with regard to this project, other than the positive impression that AWS has made in the past, is the balance of complexity and fun outlined in the spec. The visualisation of the network will provide an interesting challenge in its own right, and the inherent interactivity that will form part of the system is what eventually drove me to choose this project as my top pick.
