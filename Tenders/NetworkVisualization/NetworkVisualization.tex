\section{The Team}
	\subsection{Gian Paolo Buffo}
	\textbf{Profile:}\\
	My favourite part about software development is being able to blend creativity and functionality to create efficient, interactive and engaging software. I am most interested in multimedia software implementations, where the user experience comes above all else. In my spare time I like to go hiking or geek it out with a good book, videogame or boardgame.

	\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
		This project presents an interesting challenge which would be very satisfying to solve.
		
		Personally I want to do this project as I am fascinated by the intricacies and the workings of networks. By doing this project I feel as though I would learn an immense amount about networks that could only be learnt by doing something as in-depth as this project. This project offers many different sets of problems from the algorithmic and data structure problems to the visualising of the information problems, all of which are problems which I would enjoy solving.
		
		Another main reason for me wanting to do this project is the fact that I enjoy and am skilled in the effective presenting and communicating of information. I feel as though this project offers a great platform to manipulate and visualise very complex information. As a student I too have experienced the problems of not being able to accurately visualise the workings of a network. I believe that given software which would be able to visualise the intricacies of a network it would assist with the understandings of said network greatly.
		
		Expanding on the above, this is a project which I would be heavily and personally invested in as it offers many challenging rewards for completing it. The software being designed is something which I would personally want to use and being able to create software which one would want to use is enough motivation in and of itself.
