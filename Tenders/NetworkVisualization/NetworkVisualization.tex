		\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
			One part of computer technology that has always captured my imagination is the beauty of complexity that can occur in systems, no matter how simple they might seem on the surface. This project presents an opportunity to help others understand the underlying structure of a large, complex system, and I am always looking for chances to help others understand how systems work.
\\\\		
			The complexity of the problem at hand is enticing. I enjoy a challenge and finding solutions to problems is very satisfying for me; the harder the problem, the more satisfying it is to solve. The difficulty of visualising large, complex networks, and then optimizing that solution, is a challenge I would very much like to tackle.
\\\\			
			I am interested in the opportunity to be creative with the solution that this project presents. Being able to introduce my own skills and strengths into the project is a great opportunity to really push myself and expand my toolset of skills.
\\\\			
			Finally, I am looking forward to learning and using the EC2 API. The idea of flexible server hosting that can dynamically grow and change as needed is very interesting, and having the chance to work with the platform would be a great opportunity to learn and grow my skills.

	\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
	Having taken Computer Networks as a 3rd year module, I was overjoyed to find that my high 	expectations were well met. 
\\\\
There is an intangible beauty and satisfaction that comes with figuring out how to make machines talk to one another. From the humble beginnings of a simple Telnet chat system, one can already see the immense potential that lies behind networking. I am happy with how much I have managed to learn about the intricacies of networking in a short time, but I am not yet satisfied. I know that there is still so much more to learn, and I cannot wait.
\\\\
	What really stood out for me with regard to this project, other than the positive impression that AWS has made in the past, is the balance of complexity and fun outlined in the spec. The visualisation of the network will provide an interesting challenge in its own right, and the inherent interactivity that will form part of the system is what eventually drove me to choose this project as my top pick.

	\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
	I believe this project will be fun, challenging and rewarding. I would also like to learn more about Amazon's EC2 and how the Amazon servers work. I love visualisations, and believe that this project provides a great opportunity to be very creative, but also write cool algorithms.

		\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
		Personally I want to do this project as I am fascinated by the intricacies and the workings of networks. By doing this project I feel as though I would learn an immense amount about networks that could only be learnt by doing something as in-depth as this project. This project offers many different sets of problems from the algorithmic and data structure problems to the visualising of the information problems, all of which are problems which I would enjoy solving.
\\\\		
		Another main reason for me wanting to do this project is the fact that I enjoy and am skilled in the effective presentation and communication of information. I feel as though this project offers a great platform to manipulate and visualise very complex information. As a student I too have experienced the problems of not being able to accurately visualise the workings of a network.
\\\\		
		Expanding on the above, this is a project which I would be heavily and personally invested in as it offers many challenging rewards for completing it. The software being designed is something which I would personally want to use and being able to create software which one would want to use is enough motivation in and of itself.

	\subsection{Development Methodology}

	\subsection{Methods of Informing Client}

	\subsection{Initial Ideas for Solving Technical Challenges}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The network complexity of a large customer presents our greatest challenge, in order to solve such a problem it is important to understand some of the theory behind network science
			\item Such theory includes graph theory. We intend to look into using a graph data structure in order to map out the network
			\begin{itemize}
				\item This will enable us to effectively represent the network through the use of vertices for network nodes as well as links between these vertices for data links
				\item We would possibly be able to use the weightings of each edge to represent information such as distance or response time between each node
				\item Each vertex itself would be a data structure containing the relevant information about the node it represents
			\end{itemize}
			\item A large customer would most likely have a complex network with non-trivial topological features. Such features would require the use of efficient graph algorithms to perform operations on
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Graph theory provides many different algorithms which we would be able to apply to the network depending on its structure
				\item Algorithms such as Dikstra's algorithm or the Bellman-Ford algorithm could be used to determine the shortest path between nodes within a graph. Information such as this could be used to improve the efficiency of traversing the network
				\item The network of course may not necessarily remain static and is more than likely dynamic. In this case it is important to ensure routing is done periodically to ensure we are always working on an up to date representation of the network
			\end{itemize}
			\item As for the visualising of the network, that brings in a host of new and diverse technical challenges to solve
			\begin{itemize}
				\item In order to create the web page one could consider using AngularJS as it provides very good support for dynamic views in web-applications
				\item HTML5's canvas introduces a convenient and efficient way to use scripting to display visualised information on a web page
				\item WebGL provides a JavaScript API for rendering 2D and 3D computer graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of any plugins or add-ons
				\begin{itemize}
					\item WebGL enables the use of GPU accelerated graphics. Integrated graphics processors are becoming more prevalent on lower end devices meaning the use of WebGL may be a valid solution
					\item Three.js could be used in conjunction with WebGL as it is a very lightweight library which improves the ease of use of WebGL greatly and requires no plugins or add-ons
					\item Whilst WebGL is able to run on lower performance devices such as mobile phones it is important that more research is done on the viability of using WebGL considering the restriction of the webpage having to be able to run on a low end consumer laptop
					\item If WebGL is not viable the HTML5 canvas with the use of JavaScript is another solution which would be able to deliver the product
				\end{itemize}
				\item Through the possible combination of WebGL, JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas we would be able to create an effective solution to the visualising of the information which we have gatheredg
			\end{itemize}
			\item It could also be a good idea to make use of the Model-view-controller architectural pattern so as to separate the internal representations of the information from the ways the information is presented to the user. MVC is a popular choice for designing web pages
		\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Possible Technologies to Use for Project}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Ideally we would want to create a RESTful API which would be able to communicate with our web system over HTTP through the use of URIs
			\item It is possible to create a RESTful API to be run on a server using a variety of different languages and technologies, some being:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item C/C++ - Fast and efficient
				\item Java - Slower but more intuitive
				\item Django/Python - Slowest yet easier to program and forces the use of MVC
				\item Node.js - Lightweight and efficient
			\end{itemize}
			\item Each language/technology has its advantages and disadvantages. A final decision would be more wise to make after consulting with the client as well as learning more about the EC2 API
			\item As for the web page technologies the following would be viable
			\begin{itemize}
				\item HTML5 \& canvas
				\item JavaScript
				\item WebGl
				\item Three.js
				\item AngularJS
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
