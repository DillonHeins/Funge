		\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
			One part of computer technology that has always captured my imagination is the beauty of complexity that can occur in systems, no matter how simple they might seem on the surface. This project presents an opportunity to help others understand the underlying structure of a large, complex system, and I am always looking for chances to help others understand how systems work.
\\\\		
			The complexity of the problem at hand is enticing. I enjoy a challenge and finding solutions to problems is very satisfying for me; the harder the problem, the more satisfying it is to solve. The difficulty of visualising large, complex networks, and then optimizing that solution, is a challenge I would very much like to tackle.
\\\\			
			I am interested in the opportunity to be creative with the solution that this project presents. Being able to introduce my own skills and strengths into the project is a great opportunity to really push myself and expand my toolset of skills.
\\\\			
			Finally, I am looking forward to learning and using the EC2 API. The idea of flexible server hosting that can dynamically grow and change as needed is very interesting, and having the chance to work with the platform would be a great opportunity to learn and grow my skills.

	\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
	Having taken Computer Networks as a 3rd year module, I was overjoyed to find that my high 	expectations were well met. 
\\\\
There is an intangible beauty and satisfaction that comes with figuring out how to make machines talk to one another. From the humble beginnings of a simple Telnet chat system, one can already see the immense potential that lies behind networking. I am happy with how much I have managed to learn about the intricacies of networking in a short time, but I am not yet satisfied. I know that there is still so much more to learn, and I cannot wait.
\\\\
	What really stood out for me with regard to this project, other than the positive impression that AWS has made in the past, is the balance of complexity and fun outlined in the spec. The visualisation of the network will provide an interesting challenge in its own right, and the inherent interactivity that will form part of the system is what eventually drove me to choose this project as my top pick.

	\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
	I believe this project will be fun, challenging and rewarding. I would also like to learn more about Amazon's EC2 and how the Amazon servers work. I love visualisations, and believe that this project provides a great opportunity to be very creative, but also write cool algorithms.

		\subsubsection{Motivation for Choosing Project}
		Personally I want to do this project as I am fascinated by the intricacies and the workings of networks. By doing this project I feel as though I would learn an immense amount about networks that could only be learnt by doing something as in-depth as this project. This project offers many different sets of problems from the algorithmic and data structure problems to the visualising of the information problems, all of which are problems which I would enjoy solving.
\\\\		
		Another main reason for me wanting to do this project is the fact that I enjoy and am skilled in the effective presentation and communication of information. I feel as though this project offers a great platform to manipulate and visualise very complex information. As a student I too have experienced the problems of not being able to accurately visualise the workings of a network.
\\\\		
		Expanding on the above, this is a project which I would be heavily and personally invested in as it offers many challenging rewards for completing it. The software being designed is something which I would personally want to use and being able to create software which one would want to use is enough motivation in and of itself.
