\section{A World of Plants}
	\subsection{Intro}
		This project involves the networking and monitoring of living plants so as to be able to analyse aspects of their environment such as water intake, lighting, mineral composition and temperature. These results will be used to create a collaborative platform on which users may learn from them so as to grow the best possible plants. The platform's intended use is to encourage younger generations to become interested in agriculture so as to stimulate South Africa's agricultural industry. We plan to implement gamification on our platform as a way to encourage competition amongst users. Given enough time we would like to use AI to learn how to analyse the growth of a plant so that we may automate the process. Through doing this we would like to create an even greater challenge, which is for users to attempt to grow a plant better than our control plant grown with AI.

	\subsection{Hardware Requirements}
		\subsubsection{Base Requirements}
			The following items are necessities for each unit:
			\begin{list}
				\item Raspberry Pi
				\item Arduino
				\item 4-channel relay (voltage control)
				\item Wi-Fi adapter (not necessary if using Raspberry Pi 3 or later)
				\item Grow Light (can be bought as LED array, bulbs or as LED strips by the meter)
				\item Humidifier
				\item Humidity sensors
				\item Temperature sensors
			\end{list}
		\subsubsection{Additional}
			The following items are not necessary to have, but would extend the functionality of the final project:
			\begin{list}
				\item CO2 sensor
				\item Light intensity sensor
				\item pH sensor
				\item Heater
				\item Air pump and stone (for airflow control)
			\end{list}
