At the moment our team has communication lines set up using:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Slack - integrated with GitHub
			\item Telegram
		\end{itemize}
		We plan to use Slack as a formal means of communicating our project's progress. If you'd like, we can then add you, as the client, to our Slack group so that we are able to continuously communicate with you.\\\\
		Slack enables one to create channels and therefore you, as the client, would be able to choose whether you want to join our general channel to view general conversation and progress or we could create another channel on which we periodically post important information and progress as well as ask for your feedback.\\\\
		If you, as the client, feel it is necessary we can schedule periodic video call sessions in order to discuss our progress and receive feedback.\\\\
		In general though we are very flexible and no matter the platform the client prefers we will ensure to keep you continuously updated as well as ask for and implement any feedback.
