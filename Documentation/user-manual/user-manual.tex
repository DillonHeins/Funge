\textit{Disclaimer: The system is still under development. All documentation will be updated as the system progresses}

\section{System Overview}
	A World of Plants makes use of networked hardware devices to allow users to use the Internet to monitor and control the environment of living plants in real time.
	
	The system has been designed to make independent agriculture a fun and personalised experience. Compete to unlock new rewards or progress at your own leisure. Follow the plant suggestions to-the-letter or follow your own intuition. It's all up to you.
	
	Welcome to A World of Plants.

\section{System Configuration}
	A World of Plants is made up of 3 distinct parts:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Plant Box}, where your plants will live and grow. Your sensors will sit here as well.
		\item \textbf{The Cloud}, where all the behind-the-scenes magic takes place. Without this, there would be no data persistence, storage or communication.
		\item \textbf{Web app}, which you'll use to view plant info, interact with plants, and see how far you're progressing.
	\end{itemize}

\section{Troubleshooting}
	The system has been designed to return varying HTTP status codes depending on whether an operation was successful or not. If a user would like to see more detail with regard to these codes they may open the developer console on their preferred browser. However, the system automatically responds to these codes and handles them accordingly.\\
	
	The details of these HTTP status codes are listed below:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 200 - success
			\begin{itemize}
				\item This is the code returned when all operations are functioning as expected
				\item The system should continue without any problems or user intervention
			\end{itemize}
		\item 400 - client error
			\begin{itemize}
				\item This code is associated with bad requests
				\item A bad request occurs whenever a request fails validation, i.e. when a client formats the request in a manner that the system was not expecting
				\item This could occur when the user enters incorrect details or when a page is requested that does not exist
			\end{itemize}
			\begin{figure}[H]
				\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../images/UserManual/400error.png}
				\caption{Incorrect User Details Error}
			\end{figure}
		\item 500 - server error
			\begin{itemize}
				\item This occurs when an internal error occurs on the server. The server will attempt to resolve this issue without user intervention as best as possible.
				\item The user may be notified if the error affects them
			\end{itemize}
