\textit{Disclaimer: The system is still under development. All documentation will be updated as the system progresses}

\section{Introduction}
	In order to test our system, we need to do unit tests, integration and system tests and performance and stress tests. There are two main halves, namely the back end and front end.

\section{Back End}
	\subsection{Objectives and Tasks}
		In order to fully test the back end component of the project, we need to ensure that a number of connections are in place and are working as expected:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{From the device to IoT}
			\item{From IoT to Lambda}
			\item{From Lambda to DynamoDB}
			\\
			\item{From API Gateway to Lambda}
			\item{From Lambda to the device's shadow via IoT}
			\item{From the shadow to the device}
		\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Scope}
		For each of the above mentioned steps, we must write a unit test that is automated. We must then write tests to test
		the integration of each of the steps with each other. Finally, we must test how the back end functions with the front
		end, testing the system as a whole.
	
	\subsection{Testing Strategy}
		\subsubsection{Unit Testing}
			In order to test the functionality of the device, we have created a mock device using the AWS IoT Device SDK for
			JavaScript, and have coded the mock device using NodeJS.  
			\begin{itemize}
				\item TestUpdate
				\item TestUpdateShadow
				\item TestSomethingElse
			\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{System and Integration Testing}
			We will test how the lambda and device link with the front end.
		\subsubsection{Performance and Stress Testing}
			We will test the system under load and with multiple devices and users logged in.
